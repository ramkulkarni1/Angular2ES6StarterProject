# Angular2 + ES6 Starter Project

This is a starter project for Angular2 using Babel (for ES6), Webpack and Gulp. It is a simple app login demo app. To build the project -

1. npm install

You can start the server either using gulp or webpack-dev-server.

2. gulp

Or, to run webpack-dev-server

1. npm install -g webpack-dev-server
2. webpack-dev-server

To run the application -
